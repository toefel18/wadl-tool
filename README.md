# WADL-Tool

The [Web Application Description Language (WADL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language) 
 is a machine-readable XML description of HTTP-based web services. WADL is the REST equivalent of SOAP's WSDL.

This (unfinished) project parses WADL files and lists the available REST resources in a GUI. Users can then
 interact with those resources and inspect the request/response data. A possible extension would be to record
 the interactions, store them, and execute them automatically from the command line as a test automation tool
